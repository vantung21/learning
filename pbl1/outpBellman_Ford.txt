Starting Bellman_Ford's algorithm from 1 to 5...
Step-by-step visualization:

 Iteration 1 
Current distances:
   0  INF  INF  INF  INF 
   Relaxing edge 1->5: new distance = 64
   Relaxing edge 1->4: new distance = 465
   Relaxing edge 1->3: new distance = 46
   Relaxing edge 1->2: new distance = 45
   Relaxing edge 2->5: new distance = 51
   Relaxing edge 2->4: new distance = 50

 Iteration 2 
Current distances:
   0   45   46   50   51 
No changes detected - final distances:
   0   45   46   50   51 

 _FINAL_RESULT_ 
Shortest distance from (1) to (5): 51
Path:
(1) -> (2) -> (5)
