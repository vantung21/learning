Starting Dijkstra's algorithm from 1 to 5...
Step-by-step visualization:

 Processing vertex 1 
Current distances:
 >0<  INF  INF  INF  INF 
   Relaxing edge 1->5: new distance = 88
   Relaxing edge 1->4: new distance = 44
   Relaxing edge 1->2: new distance = 99

 Processing vertex 4 
Current distances:
 |0|  99  INF  >44<  88 

 Processing vertex 5 
Current distances:
 |0|  99  INF  |44|  >88< 

 _FINAL_RESULT_ 
Shortest distance from (1) to (5): 88
Path:
(1) -> (5)
